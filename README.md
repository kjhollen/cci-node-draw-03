# Hello Node!

Building on our [first socket drawing app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cci-node-socket-draw-02?path=README.md%3A1%3A0),
this example bundles together gestures/strokes as a series of points from mouse pressed to mouse released, and sends an array of points.
See `client.js` for updates to the p5.js code, including using an array to store a list of points in the current stroke and using a p5.Graphics object for drawing.
The p5.Graphics object is used to draw strokes received from the server so that they can be layered with real-time user feedback for the client (e.g. the current stroke the user is drawing, if there is one).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.
This project uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
Please do not upgrade to Express version 5, which is incompatible with the version of node.js that Glitch uses.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript.
If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `public/client.js`: The JavaScript for the site's front-end. This connects to a socket to talk to the server and contains our p5.js code.

‚Üê `public/index.html`: This is the main index for the site. In other Glitch examples, you may see HTML templates with libraries like Handlebars instead of an index.html

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. In this example, we set up some simple socket communication in addition to serving HTML, CSS, and JS files.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

Note: this is a template developed by Glitch and uses Fastify instead of Express.
Both libraries are similar in function, but have different syntax.
